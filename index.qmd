## What is [Quarto]{.blue}?

<br>

- Multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from Posit (i.e., RStudio)  
<br>
- R Markdown isn't going away <a href='https://yihui.org/en/2022/04/quarto-r-markdown/'>(see this post)</a>  
<br>
- However, all new features will be implemented in Quarto  
<br>
- Render .Rmd as [.qmd]{.blue} without any changes - try it!  
<br>

## What is [Reveal.js]{.golden}?

<br>

- Open source HTML presentation framework
<br>  
- **Very** flexible - anything you can do with a webpage
<br>  
- Lucky for us, included in [Quarto]{.blue} as the preferred presentation format
<br>  
- Already <a href='https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/'>very well-documented by Posit!</a>

## What were/are the alternatives?

<br>

- `xaringan`: all functionality and more included in [Reveal.js]{.golden}
<br>   
- Google Slides: great, especially if you don't need inline code
<br>   
- Powerpoint: ???

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{{r}}
1 + 1
```
`````

## Columns are easy!

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
First column

Amazing!
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Second column

Wow!
:::

:::

## Columns are easy! 

::: columns

::: {.column width="33%"}
First column

Amazing!
:::

::: {.column width="34%"}
Second column

Wow!
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
Third column?!

Astounding!
:::

:::

::: aside

::: {.fragment}
Just need to specify `{column width="x%"}` for each column
:::

## Absolute positioning

![](images/cat1.jpeg){.absolute top=200 left=0 width="350"}

![](images/cat2.jpeg){.absolute top=50 right=50 width="300"}

![](images/cat3.jpeg){.absolute bottom=0 right="30%" width="400"}

::: {.absolute top=300 right=20}
Put images and text wherever you want!
:::


## Vertical centering {.center}

Is normally super hard but now simple!

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
## Horizontal centering

Is a little trickier
:::


## {.center}

we can have
[big text]{.r-fit-text}
as big as the screen can fit!

## Other fun things
